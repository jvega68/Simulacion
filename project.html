<h2>Dataset 1 –Reproductivity and longevity.</h2>

<p><B>Background</B></P>

<p>Scientists are interested in whether the energy costs involved in reproduction affect longevity. Data from Hanley and Shapiro (1994).</p>

<p><B>Experiment and data.</B></p>

<p>In this experiment, 125 male fruit flies were divided at random into five sets of 25. In one group, the males were kept by themselves. In two groups, the males were supplied with 1 or 8 receptive virgin female fruit flies per day. In the final two groups, the males were supplied with 1 or 8 unreceptive (pregnant) female fruit plies per day. Other than the number and type of companions, the males were treated identically. The longevity of the flies was observed, and data is summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>1. Reproductive activity does affect longevity?</p> 
<P>2. How the groups are different? Which are similar? We can compare between company or not, or virgin or not, or how much company the fly had.</p>

<p>Hints for a good analysis</p>
<P>Think about normality assumptions carefully. </p>
<p>Do a descriptive analysis first. Verify carefully every assumption of the model that you are planing to use, and justify plenty why you choose such model.</p>

<h2>Dataset 2 - Sleep Requirements</h2>
<P><B>Background</B></P>
<P>All known mammalian species spend at least part of each day sleeping, some 
species sleeping more than others. Sleep must serve some biological function, 
but why do sleep requirements vary so much from species to species? One approach 
to getting information that might help understand this question is to study the 
dependence of hours of sleep on species characteristics. The problem of interest 
is to understand the dependence of hours of sleep on the other species 
characteristics recorded in the data.</P>

<DIR>
<P><I>Sleep:</I> Total sleep, hrs/day</P>
<P><I>Body:</I> Body weight, log<SUB>2</SUB>(kg)</P>
<P><I>Brain:</I> Brain weight, log<SUB>2</SUB>(g)</P>
<P><I>Life:</I> Maximum life span, log<SUB>2</SUB>(years)</P>
<P><I>Gest:</I> Gestation time, log<SUB>2</SUB>(days)</P>
<P><I>Danger:</I> Danger index, 0 = relatively low danger from other animals, 1 
= relatively high danger from other animals</P></DIR>
<P>[Note that the units for some of the predictors are logarithmic (to base 2). 
This "transformation" is often made for biological data like these and often 
leads to better-fitting models. One way to think about this transformation is 
that when, for example, gestation time (in days) doubles, <I>Gest</I> (which is 
gestation time in log<SUB>2</SUB>(days)) increases by 1. In terms of analyzing 
the data, you don't need to worry about this - just take the data as they 
are.]</P>

<P><B>Experiment and data</B></P>
<P>We have data on 51 species, covering many different orders of mammals. This 
is surely not a random sample of species, so some care must be taken in 
generalizing any results to all mammal species. The variables defined above are 
species averages. To save space, only a couple of the species are shown below - 
the full dataset (response and predictor values only, not names of species) is 
available on the class web-site with the name <span style='font-family:Courier'>

  <TT>Danger</TT>?
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>What does your final model from Question 4 mean in terms of the

  <P></P>
  <P></P>

  <TT>Life=4</TT>, <TT>Gest=7</TT>, and <TT>Danger=0</TT> to sleep?

<h2>Dataset 3 - CPU faults</h2>
<P><B>Background</B></P>
<P>Some computers divide memory into pages. When a program runs, it is allocated a certain number of pages of RAM. The program itself may require more pages than were allocated. When this is the case, currently unused pages are stored on disk. From time to time, a page stored on disk is needed; this is called a <EM>page fault</EM>. When a page fault occurs, one of the currently active pages must be moved to disk in order to make room for the page that must be brought in from disk. The trick is to choose a "good" page to send out to disk, where a "good" means a page that will not be used soon.</P>

<P><B>Experiment and data</B></P>
<P>The experiment consists of running different programs on a computer under different configurations and counting the number of page faults. There were two paging algorithms to study, and this is the factor of primary interest. A second factor with three levels was the sequence in which system routines were initialized. Factor three was the size of the program (small, medium or large memory requirements), and factor four was the amount of RAM memory allocated (large, medium or small). The data is given as follows:

<h2>Dataset 4 - Moral integration</h2>
<P><B>Background</B></P>
<P>Angell's index of "moral integration" (i.e. social integration) combines information on the incidence of crime with data on social welfare expenditures. Cities that have low crime rates and high levels of welfare effort are assigned high moral-integration scores. The ethnic-heterogeneity index is calculated from the proportions of nonwhites and foreign-born whites residing in the cities, and the mobility index is constructed from the proportions of residents moving into and out of the cities. Angell argues that the moral integration of cities should decrease with ethnic heterogeneity and geographic mobility.</P>
