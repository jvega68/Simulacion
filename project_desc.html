<P><B>Technique:</B> Have you used appropriate statistical techniques and checked assumptions underlying inferences?</P>
<P><B>Clarity:</B> Have you explained clearly and concisely what you have done and why, and what your conclusions are?</P>
<P><B>Focus:</B> Have you answered the questions fully and without superfluous analyses or discussion?</P>
<P><B>Overall presentation:</B> Is the report presented neatly and in a professional manner?</P>
<P>A suggested <B>layout</B> for the report is as follows:</P>
<P><B>Dataset 1</B></P>
<P><I>Introduction:</I> Briefly restate the questions and describe the experiment conducted.</P>
<P><I>Analysis:</I> Describe the statistical techniques applied and the assumptions underlying any inferences.</P>
<P><I>Results:</I> Summarize the results of the analysis, including any relevant plots.</P>
<P><I>Conclusions:</I> Describe how the results answer the questions.</P>
<P><B>Dataset 2</B>
<P><I>Introduction:</I> Briefly restate the questions and describe the experiment conducted.</P>
<P><I>Analysis:</I> Describe the statistical techniques applied and the assumptions underlying any inferences.</P>
<P><I>Results:</I> Summarize the results of the analysis, including any relevant plots.</P>
<P><I>Conclusions:</I> Describe how the results answer the questions.</P>
<P><B>Appendix:</B> Include relevant MacAnova commands and output you used in your analyses. (You can, and should, put MacAnova plots in the main body of the report, but do <I>not</I> put MacAnova commands and text output in the main body of the report.)</P>
<P><B>Length:</B> The main body of the report must be <I>no more than 10 pages.</I> I would suggest maybe 3 pages on dataset 1 and 6 pages on dataset 2. <I>Anything beyond 10 pages will be ignored in grading.</I> The Appendix may be as long (or short!) as you wish.</P>
<P><B>Teams:</B> You may work on this either <I>individually</I> or in <I>teams</I> of up to <I>four.</I> Whether you work in a team or not, you may discuss the project with others. Hand in just <I>one</I> report per team at the end of the final exam.</P>
<P><B>Scoring:</B> A <I>cover-page</I> (not included in the page limit above) must accompany each report. On this, state the name of each person contributing to the report, together with a signature and student ID number for each person, and also an estimate of each person's overall contribution to the report. Everyone on the team must agree on the estimated contributions (which must sum to 100%), for example:

<PRE>Joe Shmo; [signature]; ID 1234569;  40%
Jane Doe; [signature]; ID 24681012; 60%
</PRE>

Everyone on the team gets the same score (out of 100), unless the contributions of the team-members are unequal. Then, scores for team-members contributing less than their fair share (50% for 2-person teams, 33 1/3 % for 3-person teams, 25% for 4-person teams) will be scaled relative to the fair share, while scores for team-members contributing more than their fair share will not be scaled. So, for example, if the project that Joe Shmo and Jane Doe turn in gets an overall score of 90, Joe Shmo would get a score of <TT>(40/50)*90=72</TT> and Jane Doe would get a score of <TT>90</TT>.</P>
<P><B>Dataset 1 - Catnip Bonanza</B></P>
<P><B>Background</B></P>
<P>The Berea, Ohio, animal shelter has a "no-kill" policy, which means that several cats live at the shelter for months. During shifts, healthy cats are allowed to wander the shelter, as cooping them up for the duration would be cruel. Inevitably, however, some of them tend to be less tolerant of sharing their domain with others and lash out, possibly hurting one another. An experiment was conducted to study whether ingesting catnip causes a decrease in amiability in resident cats of the shelter. It had been noticed that while catnip seemed to elicit silly, playful behavior, it also appeared to cause more fights between the animals, especially between notoriously crabby residents. While observing the cats after eating catnip is fun, if this herb did enhance frequency of negative interactions, perhaps shift workers should allow only the friendlier cats to consume it. The results of this study can hopefully help manage shifts to minimize hostility among residents.</P>
<B><P>Experiment and data</P></B>
<P>The experiment employed 15 randomly chosen feline residents. Each was placed in the middle of a room with 20 other residents (same for all trials), and negative interactions instigated by the subject were recorded for 15 minutes to establish baselines of amiability for each. Instances where the subject was the victim of another’s negative behavior were not recorded (negative behavior included swatting, hissing, biting, etc.). Residents were then given a teaspoon of "Cosmic Catnip," and negative interactions were measured for a second period of 15 minutes, beginning as soon as the subject finished eating. The measurements were collected on the same day within 1/2 hour of one another and were as follows:</P>

<P><B>Questions</B></P>
<OL>

<P><LI>Do residents, on average, instigate more negative interactions with others under the influence of catnip than when "sober"?</LI></P>
<P><LI>Is the experiment that was used better for answering question 1 than an alternative experiment in which catnip was given to one group of 15 cats and a placebo was given to a different group of 15 cats? Why?</LI></P></OL>

<P><B>Hints for a good analysis</B></P>

<UL>
<P><LI>Think about any normality assumptions carefully (remember normal random variables are continuous, not discrete).</LI></P>
<P><LI>Recall that the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test on differences ignores any differences equal to zero; to remove the zeros from a vector <TT>d</TT> in MacAnova type <TT>d <- d[d!=0]</TT> (<TT>!=</TT> means "not equal to" in MacAnova).</LI></P></UL>

<P><B>Dataset 2 - Sleep Requirements</B></P>
<P><B>Background</B></P>
<P>All known mammalian species spend at least part of each day sleeping, some species sleeping more than others. Sleep must serve some biological function, but why do sleep requirements vary so much from species to species? One approach to getting information that might help understand this question is to study the dependence of hours of sleep on species characteristics. The problem of interest is to understand the dependence of hours of sleep on the other species characteristics recorded in the data.</P>
<DIR>

<P><I>Sleep:</I> Total sleep, hrs/day</P>
<P><I>Body:</I> Body weight, log<SUB>2</SUB>(kg)</P>
<P><I>Brain:</I> Brain weight, log<SUB>2</SUB>(g)</P>
<P><I>Life:</I> Maximum life span, log<SUB>2</SUB>(years)</P>
<P><I>Gest:</I> Gestation time, log<SUB>2</SUB>(days)</P>
<P><I>Danger:</I> Danger index, 0 = relatively low danger from other animals, 1 = relatively high danger from other animals</P></DIR>

<P>[Note that the units for some of the predictors are logarithmic (to base 2). This "transformation" is often made for biological data like these and often leads to better-fitting models. One way to think about this transformation is that when, for example, gestation time (in days) doubles, <I>Gest</I> (which is gestation time in log<SUB>2</SUB>(days)) increases by 1. In terms of analyzing the data, you don't need to worry about this - just take the data as they are.]</P>
<P><B>Experiment and data</B></P>
<P>We have data on 51 species, covering many different orders of mammals. This is surely not a random sample of species, so some care must be taken in generalizing any results to all mammal species. The variables defined above are species averages. To save space, only a couple of the species are shown below - the full dataset (response and predictor values only, not names of species) is available on the class web-site under "Data".</P>

<P><B>Questions</B></P>
<OL START=3>

<P><LI>Ignoring <TT>Body</TT>, <TT>Brain</TT>, and <TT>Life</TT> for now, how does the dependence of <TT>Sleep</TT> on <TT>Gest</TT> differ for different levels of <TT>Danger</TT>?</LI></P>
<P><LI>Now considering all 5 predictors, what is a good multiple linear regression model that describes the dependence of <TT>Sleep</TT> on <TT>Body</TT>, <TT>Brain</TT>, <TT>Life</TT>, <TT>Gest</TT>, and <TT>Danger</TT>?</LI></P>
<P><LI>What does your final model from Question 4 mean in terms of the association between <TT>Sleep</TT> and <TT>Body</TT>, <TT>Brain</TT>, <TT>Life</TT>, <TT>Gest</TT>, and <TT>Danger</TT>?</LI></P>
<P><LI>Based on your final model from Question 4, how much should I expect the average amount of sleep for mammals with <TT>Body=2</TT>, <TT>Brain=5</TT>, <TT>Life=4</TT>, <TT>Gest=7</TT>, and <TT>Danger=0</TT> to be? How much should I expect an actual mammal with <TT>Body=2</TT>, <TT>Brain=5</TT>, <TT>Life=4</TT>, <TT>Gest=7</TT>, and <TT>Danger=0</TT> to sleep?</LI></P></OL>

<P><B>Hints for a good analysis</B></P>
<OL START=3>

<P><LI>Decide which of the four models (equal intercepts and slopes, different intercepts / same slopes, same intercepts / different slopes, same intercepts and slopes) is most appropriate.</LI></P>
<P><LI>There are a variety of methods you can employ to come up with a good model – just write up what seems to you to be the most satisfactory analysis.</LI></P>
<P><LI>Interpret the estimates in your model to answer this question.</LI></P>
<P><LI>Any of the 5 predictors that don’t appear in your model can be ignored. Also, make sure you give some indication of the variability in your answer here and not just a "best guess".</LI></P></OL>
